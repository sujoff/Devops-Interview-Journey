# Terraform: Infrastructure as Code

This repository is about my Journey to Terraform, an open-source tool for infrastructure as code (IaC). Terraform allows you to define, provision, and manage infrastructure across various cloud providers, hardware, and software platforms. Basically, If you're getting to Devops world, I would say Terraform is must.

## What is Terraform?

Terraform is a comrehensive declarative IaC tool. You define the desired state of your infrastructure using configuration files written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). Terraform then translates your configuration into API calls to create, update, or destroy resources in your target platform. This approach offers several benefits:

  - **Repeatability:** Consistent infrastructure deployments across environments (Yes IT'S Multiplatform based, and that's a good benefit).
  - **Version control:** You can track changes with Git or other version control systems.
  - **Collaboration:** Share and collaborate on infrastructure definitions with teams.
  - **Reduced errors:** Minimize human error and maximize consistent configurations.

## Structure of Terraform Projects

A typical Terraform project includes the following components:

  - **Configuration files (`.tf`):** These files define the desired infrastructure state using HCL syntax.
  - **Providers:** Terraform plugins that interact with specific cloud providers, hardware platforms, or software services. You configure providers within your Terraform configuration files.
  - **Modules (optional):** Reusable configuration blocks that encapsulate common infrastructure patterns. They promote code reuse and maintainability.
  - **State file (`.terraform.state`):** Tracks the managed infrastructure's state and maps resources to their real-world identifiers. This file should be kept confidential.
  - **Backend configuration (optional):** Specifies how Terraform stores the state file. Common backends include local storage, remote storage (e.g., S3), and Terraform Cloud.

## Getting Started with Terraform

Here's a basic workflow for using Terraform:

1. **Install Terraform:** Download and install Terraform from the official website https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli.
2. **Initialize your project:** Navigate to your project directory and run `terraform init`. This command downloads and installs any required providers.
3. **Write your configuration:** Create `.tf` files defining your desired infrastructure using HCL syntax. Resources, providers, outputs, and variables are common components in Terraform configurations.
4. **Validate your configuration:** Run `terraform validate` to check for syntax errors and potential issues.
5. **Preview changes:** Run `terraform plan` to see what Terraform will create, update, or destroy based on your current configuration.
6. **Apply changes (optional):** If you're satisfied with the plan, run `terraform apply` to provision your infrastructure.
